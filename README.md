# PROACTIVE DISASTER DETECTION

The main concept of the project is to predict the earthquakes before
hand using deep learning with historical data to predict the future outcomes.


# Prerequisites

Download Python version 3.6 variant form the offical python website
(https://www.python.org/) and set the necessary path variable for the python

**Anaconda:**
It is an easy made IDE for python which can be downloaded from the website 
(https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) and install it.

**Browser:**
The executing environment needs to have a preinstalled browser for visualizing
the output.

**DataSet:**
Find the preprocessed data set named as db.csv

## Install Packages

All the packages files can be installed from the Command Prompt if the path is already set. Rather than using pip, it is recommended to use conda to
install the packages. The commands required to install the packages are 
given below.

**PANDAS:**
conda install -c anaconda pandas 

**NUMPY:**
conda install -c anaconda numpy

**SCIKIT-LEARN**
conda install -c anaconda scikit-learn

**KERAS:**
conda install -c conda-forge keras 
conda install -c conda-forge/label/cf201901 keras

**GEOPY:**
conda install -c conda-forge geopy 
conda install -c conda-forge/label/gcc7 geopy 
conda install -c conda-forge/label/cf201901 geopy 

**FOLIUM:**
conda install -c conda-forge folium 
conda install -c conda-forge/label/gcc7 folium 
conda install -c conda-forge/label/cf201901 folium

## Model Training

Open Anaconda and load the Spyder IDE and open the file named final.py. Set the
environment path to the location of the final.py and execute the file and wait
till it runs 100 epochs

##  Final Execution

Run the fin.py and an UI pop-up will open, give necessary inputs and wait till the
output opens in the browser.
